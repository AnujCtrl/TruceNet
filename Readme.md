# Deepfake Detection Model

This repository contains a deepfake detection model that can be used to determine whether an image is a deepfake or not. The model is built using a deep learning architecture and is trained on a large dataset of both real and deepfake images.

## Model Architecture

The deepfake detection model is based on a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture. It utilizes multiple layers of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to extract features from the input image and make a prediction. The model is trained using a binary classification approach, where a prediction of 1 indicates a deepfake image, and a prediction of 0 indicates a real image.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a diverse dataset that consists of real images and deepfake images. The real images are sourced from various publicly available image datasets, while the deepfake images are generated using state-of-the-art deepfake generation techniques. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure a balanced distribution of real and deepfake images, allowing the model to learn discriminative features.

## Model Performance

The deepfake detection model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between real and deepfake images. During the training phase, the model is evaluated on a separate validation set to monitor its performance. The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are measured to assess its effectiveness in detecting deepfakes.

## Usage

To use the deepfake detection model, follow the steps below:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Load the trained model weights by running `python load_model.py`. Make sure to specify the correct path to the model weights file.

3. Use the loaded model to make predictions on new images. You can pass the image file path as an argument to the prediction script, like `python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg`. The script will output the prediction result, indicating whether the image is a deepfake or not.

## Limitations

While the deepfake detection model achieves high accuracy, it may still have certain limitations. Some potential limitations include:

- The model's performance may vary depending on the quality of the deepfake images and the sophistication of the deepfake generation techniques.
- The model may struggle with detecting deepfake images that are generated using advanced adversarial methods specifically designed to evade detection.
- The model's performance may be affected by variations in lighting conditions, image resolution, and other factors that can impact the quality of the image.
